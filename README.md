# Conky Files

These files (specifically, '.conkyrc' and '7f000000-382x618.png') are what I use for my Conky setup, and others are welcome to them. Conky ( https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky ) is a free and open-source Unix-like system monitor for the X Window System (X11) based on Torsmo (TyopoytaORvelo System MOnitor).

The transparency effect depicted for Conky in the below picture is designed to work without compositing, as I don't use compositing. This Conky setup is known to work with xfdesktop 4.12.4 and previous versions, although I'm not sure about later versions, less still about different desktop environments. The '.conkyrc' file may require some modifications to work properly on different desktop software.

The desktop-environment theme featured below is entitled Computing Machine, and is available here: https://github.com/Jamie-Michelle/Computing-Machine

The computer-desktop background/wallpaper image featured below is entitled Angel Skin, and is available here: https://github.com/Jamie-Michelle/Angel-Skin
