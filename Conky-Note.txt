Conky on Computing Machine release No. 2 (Aug. 18, 2019) by Jamie Michelle ( https://github.com/Jamie-Michelle ). Released under the GNU General Public License, Version 2.

These files are what I use for my Conky setup, and others are welcome to them.

This Conky setup is known to work with the xfdesktop 4.14.n and 4.12.n series, although I'm not sure about different desktop environments. The '.conkyrc' file may require some modifications to work properly on different desktop software. The transparency effect depicted for Conky in the included picture is designed to work with or without compositing for the xfdesktop 4.12.n series; and with compositing enabled for the xfdesktop 4.14.n series.

For the xfdesktop 4.14.n Conky setup, see the 'New-GTK-3-Setup' directory (containing the '.conkyrc' file); and for the xfdesktop 4.12.n Conky setup, see the 'Old-GTK-2-Setup' directory (containing the '.conkyrc' and '7f000000-382x618.png' files).

The desktop-environment theme featured in the included image is entitled Computing Machine, and is available here: https://github.com/Jamie-Michelle/Computing-Machine
